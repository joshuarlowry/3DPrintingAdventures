## About This Site

This site documents my experiences with 3D printing, from basic prints to complex projects. I share both successes and failures to help others learn and improve their own 3D printing journey. 

## Resources

This site also includes a [collection of resources](docs/resources) that I've found useful in my 3D printing journey.
