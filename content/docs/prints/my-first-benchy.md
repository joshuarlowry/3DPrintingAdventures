## Print Details
The 3DBenchy is a classic 3D printer torture test and calibration model. It's often referred to as the "jolly 3D printing torture test" because it tests various aspects of a 3D printer's capabilities in one small model.

## Print Settings Notes
This specific print came with the printer, so I didn't have to make any adjustments.

## Results
Overall, I think it turned out great!

## Issues and Solutions
No issues encountered with this print.

## Lessons Learned
This being my first print, it showed that the printer was well-calibrated out of the box.
